### ðŸ“Š Control Breakdown
- **Total Controls**: 10  
- **Compliant**: 1  
- **Not Compliant**: 1  
- **Not Assessed (NA)**: 8  

The majority of maintenance controls are currently not assessed (NA), indicating a gap in ownership or process documentation. Only one control is compliant, and one is explicitly marked as non-compliant.

# Recommendation Section
st.markdown("""
### âœ… Recommendation
> Maintenance domain requires foundational process design and documentation:
> - Assign a responsible team or owner for maintenance governance.  
> - Formalize remote maintenance procedures, notifications, and cryptographic safeguards.  
> - Ensure audit logging, disconnect verification, and access restrictions are verifiable.  
> - Review SLAs with vendors to include compliance with internal control expectations.
