### âœ… Recommendations
> TDA controls are partially implemented with notable gaps in secure development practices:
> - Assign ownership for early-stage security like SBOM, code analysis, and threat remediation.  
> - Incorporate secure-by-default practices throughout the development lifecycle.  
> - Improve evidence collection and role clarity for developer responsibilities.
